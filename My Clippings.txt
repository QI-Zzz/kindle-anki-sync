First, the Prevention Through Deterrence strategy has created a setting in which the Border Patrol can draw on the agency of animals and other nonhumans to do its dirty work while simultaneously absolving itself of any blame connected to migrant injuries or loss of life. This is what Doty calls the federal government’s “moral alibi.”21 Second, describing the desert as a “deterrent” to migration both flattens the three-dimensionality of what Sarah Whatmore terms the “hybrid geography” that border crossers face and renders the various human and nonhuman political subjects who influence the movement of people across this landscape largely invisible.22 By focusing the ethnographic lens on the migrant experience, we can start to add a graphic reality to federal policy discourse.
